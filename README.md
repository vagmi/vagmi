## Making the world better one line of code at a time.

I am a technology leader with over 20 years of experience building software and software teams. I believe in servant-style leadership. I value honesty and candor in all communications. I can not only bring clarity and direction to the team but also will roll up my sleeves to implement it alongside the team when needed.
